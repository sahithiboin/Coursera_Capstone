# Coursera_Capstone
This capstone project course gave a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. Also, learnt about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare and how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Learnt how to be creative in situations where data is not readily available for scraping web data and parsing HTML code. Utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped in refining necessary skills for exploring and analyzing data. Usage the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings.
